Handling touch events is thanks to jQuery UI Touch Punch of David Furfero.
See http://touchpunch.furf.com.

(Implementation of spin/rotate/drag was independent of Touch Punch.)

Salvatore di Dio demonstrated in his RapydGlow experiment (http://salvatore.pythonanywhere.com/RapydGlow)
how he was able to use the RapydScript Python-to-JavaScript compiler with GlowScript graphics.
This inspired the implementation of the VPython (vpython.org) API at glowscript.org.
He provided the file papercomp.js for operator overloading, based on the work of
    Juerg Lehni (PaperScript: http://scratchdisk.com/posts/operator-overloading).
He also assembled support for operator overloading and the ability to write synchronous code
in the file transform-all.js, based on the work of
    Bruno Jouhier (Streamline: https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs), and
    Marijn Haverbeke (Acorn.js: https://github.com/marijnh).
Supporting the VPython API in a browser is possible thanks to the work of
    Alexander Tsepkov (RapydScript: https://bitbucket.org/pyjeon/rapydscript) and
    Charles Law (browser-based RapydScript: http://pyjeon.pythonanywhere.com/static/rapydscript_online/index.html).

When the GlowScript project was launched in 2011 by David Scherer and Bruce Sherwood,
Scherer implemented operator overloading and synchronous code using libraries existing at that time.
In 2015 it became necessary to upgrade to newer libraries because compilation failed on some browsers.
